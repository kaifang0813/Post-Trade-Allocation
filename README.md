# Post-Trade-Allocation
Post Trade Allocation Implementation based on US20130013482A1

This code is the local version of Post Trade Allocation Implementation using PYTHON for demo purpose, 
the cloud version would be based on C++ and run in distributed mode.

The project contains several Part:
1) Post Trade Dynamic allocation to minimize the pnl gap between mulitple management account traded with the same fund manager.
2) Simple UI to demo the allocation.
3) XLL Addin to easily utilize the code in excel

Post Trade Dynamic allocation algorithm: This method is based on Pattern US20130013482A1.

Component:

- post_trade_allocation.py: Allocation Algorithm Class to handle data cleaning and algorithm calculation
- new_post_trade_allocation.py: Optimization of the original code based on numbra to demonstrate the speedup with distributed mode
- allocation_optimization.py: helper function to do allocation
- jit_grid_search.py:  optimization of original code using numbra to speed up the code
- last_trade_allocation.py helper function of the optimization
- config.py config file of the related path

UI Component:
Following MVC design pattern:
- view.py
- side_pannel.py
- model.py

XLL Addin
- allocation_xll.py  using xll library
- allocation_xlwings.py using xlwings library
